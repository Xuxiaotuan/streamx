## üìä Overview

**StreamPark** is an open-source streaming application development framework and cloud-native real-time computing platform. Designed to simplify the development and management of streaming applications, StreamPark provides a development framework for developing stream processing applications using Apache Flink and Apache Spark, alongside a professional management platform. The platform covers the full lifecycle of streaming applications, including development, debugging, interactive querying, deployment, operations, and maintenance. Originally named StreamX, the project was renamed as StreamPark in August 2022 and graduated as an Apache Top-Level Project (TLP) in January 2025.
